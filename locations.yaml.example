# smugVision Custom Location Reference File
#
# This file allows you to define custom locations that will be used
# instead of reverse geocoding when photos are taken within the
# specified radius of each location.
#
# Copy this file to ~/.smugvision/locations.yaml and customize:
#   mkdir -p ~/.smugvision
#   cp locations.yaml.example ~/.smugvision/locations.yaml
#
# Why use custom locations?
# - Get friendly names for places like "Eric's House" instead of just the street address
# - Ensure consistent naming across all photos taken at the same location
# - Faster processing (no API calls needed for custom locations)
# - Add searchable aliases as tags
#
# How to find GPS coordinates:
# - Google Maps: Right-click on a location and select the coordinates
# - Apple Maps: Drop a pin and tap the info button
# - From a photo: Use 'exiftool -GPSLatitude -GPSLongitude photo.jpg'
#
# Fields:
#   name (required): The name you want displayed for this location
#   latitude (required): GPS latitude in decimal degrees
#   longitude (required): GPS longitude in decimal degrees
#   radius (optional): Match radius in meters (default: 50)
#                      Photos within this distance will match this location
#   address (optional): Street address for your reference
#   aliases (optional): Additional names to add as keyword tags

locations:
  # Example: Your home
  - name: "My House"

    longitude: -85.770201

# Tips:
# - Use a smaller radius (25-50m) for precise locations like your house
# - Use a larger radius (100-300m) for venues, parks, or large properties
# - If multiple locations overlap, the closest match wins
# - Coordinates are checked before any reverse geocoding API calls
